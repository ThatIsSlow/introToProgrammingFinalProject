# Placeholder name

This programm will scrape the website HereNow, to pull rowing regatta results out and place them elsewhere. 

## Description

Ideally this programm will be able to exist outside of VScode, either on a website using Flask, or as an application that exists as an individual file. Most likely a website if I can make it work. This will enable the input of a race, or a team, and the programm will pull from HereNow either the race, the team, all the results of the team.
