# HereNowResults Embezzeler 

This programm will scrape the website HereNow, to pull rowing regatta results out and collect them all in one spot. I am basically stealing HereNow's data. Muahahahah. 

## Description

This programm enables the user too select a team name, and the program will search the given race for all occurences of that team, and pull them out into a seperate location. 
The Run Time is very long, don't worry if it takes forever to work, it is most likley functioning as created

## Getting Started
You need to ensure that you have all of the libraries installed, as this code currently only exists within VScode.
The libraries include Selenium, Tkinter, and XLWT

### Dependencies

* You must have version 108 of Chrome in order for the webdriver to function properly

### Installing

* Download from my github, currently is self contained


### Executing program

* How to run the program
* 1. Run the programm
* 2. Your computer Needs to remain open while the code runs
* 3. Profit 


## Help

If Chromedriver fails top load the window, there is a high chance the URL you entered was wrong in some way. Run the program again
and double check your spelling.

Another common error that occurs, is that the website doesn't render. This means your connection is poor, and you need to probably move or check your wifi.
